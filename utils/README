This contains the mm9_HindIII baitmap and rmap files, which are used to convert different Hi-C analysis outputs to the input ibed for ChiCMaxima. 
There are also two scripts, one which is a generic one to convert many text-delimited output files to ibed (you just need to specify which column contains the chromosome and coordinate for each of the paired reads), 
and another one to specifically convert the BAM files from HICUP (it just matches to bait with bedtools, then runs the generic script on the temp file it generates).
